# `Zesty/processed`
Unless a path is passed to `processAppIcon.sh` (which actually isn't supported right nowâ€¦), processed app icons will be dumped into this directory by default. You should use this as a staging area, and should not rely on this directory for persistent reference to the output of this script. **The contents of this diretory _will_ be overwritten on each operation.**
